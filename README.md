- Designed the Frontend in XML and written the backend for this project in Kotlin.
- You say anything in the mic and the application will understand it and write your words in the Text Box.
- We are going to use RecognizerIntent class.
- We have given permissions to the App, in AndroidManifest file.
- The constant given for speech starts an activity that will prompt the user for speech and send it through a speech recognizer.

**EXTRA_LANGUAGE_MODEL :** Informs the recognizer which speech model to prefer when performing ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH.

**LANGUAGE_MODEL_FREE_FORM :** Use a language model based on free-form speech recognition.

**EXTRA_LANGUAGE :** Optional IETF language tag (as defined by BCP 47).
